***
This Back end uses Sequelize, mysql2 and dot.env so make sure to install them. visit (https://www.npmjs.com/) for documentation. First add your database name, mysql username and mysql password into the enviroment variable file(.env). Then you will source your schema by typing "mysql -u root -p" in the terminal. You will be prompt to enter your password and once logged in type "source db/schema.sql;" and exit. Now that you sourced your schema you can seed the database. Type "npm run seed" into the terminal. Now that we have seeded our Database we can start the app. Type "npm start" should see a Now listening in the terminal. Go to http://localhost:3001/ and test out the routes!. http://localhost:3001/api/categories for example will show data on categories and also related product data. see routes folder for more routes.
